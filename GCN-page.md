## Pose Refinement with GCN
We introduce our Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) as a plugin to enhance the estimated 3D poses. Our GCN is trained on the BlendMimic3D dataset, which provides a diverse range of occlusion scenarios. This allows the network to learn and adapt to various occlusion types, refining the pose estimation for occluded joints.
